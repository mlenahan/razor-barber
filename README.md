### Design

* Imagery

    * This website features a simple background image showing some texture on the homepage. The other images present are those for the products. I also make use of Font Awesome icons.

* Typography

    * The font used in my application is Lato. 

* Colour scheme

    * I have used a monochromatic colour scheme to align with my preference for clean, minimalistic approach to styling
 
 ### Schema

The schema overview for my application is as below:

![Image of schema overview](media/readme_screenshots/schema.jpg)<br>

As seen above, the Category table has a one-to-many link with Product as one category can contain many products.
The Order table has a one-to-many link with OrderLineItem, as one order can contain many line items. There is also a one-to-many link between Product and OrderLineItem as the same product can appear in many line items on different orders.<br><br>
There is a one-to-many relationship between UserProfile and Order as one user can have many orders associated with them. The UserProfile table also has a one-to-one link with the built-in Django User model (shown here for demonstration purposes) as each user can have only one profile linked to them. The BlogPost table has a one-to-many relationship with Reply, which allows for multiple replies to a particular blog post. There is also a one-to-many relationship between the User model and the Reply table as one user may have many replies.<br><br>
