# Razor Barber

## Overview

Razor Barber is a website selling top of the range hair products as well as allowing users to book haircuts. Users are able to browse the selection of hair cproducts and purchase them. Users will be able to look at previous orders and update their delivery details if they register an account. Admin users can add, edit and delete products. Non-admin users are also able to add, edit and delete replies to the blog posts they have made.

## Business Model

I have used a B2C buisness model for the site. The reason I chose this is because the products I will be selling are aimed at consumers and not businesses. The product selection and checkout flow allow for quick and easy purchases, which is not something you would use in a B2B environment. 

### Marketing Strategy

* I have made use of the following:

    * Social media advertising, due to it being a no cost option and potentially able to reach many users
    * Email advertising due to the relative simplicity of creating newsletters or offers for potential and existing customers
    * SEO and looking to rank well in searches on Google to aid visibility of my application

### Facebook Business Page

You can find a link to the business page [here.](https://www.facebook.com/Razor-Barber-108482478691688). There is also a link to tit in the footer of the site.

### Design

* Imagery

    * This website features a simple background image showing some texture on the homepage. The other images present are those for the products. I also make use of Font Awesome icons.

* Typography

    * The font used in my application is Lato. 

* Colour scheme

    * I have used a monochromatic colour scheme to align with my preference for clean, minimalistic approach to styling
 
 ### Schema

The schema overview for my application is as below:

![Image of schema overview](media/readme_screenshots/schema.jpg)<br>

As seen above, the Category table has a one-to-many link with Product as one category can contain many products.
The Order table has a one-to-many link with OrderLineItem, as one order can contain many line items. There is also a one-to-many link between Product and OrderLineItem as the same product can appear in many line items on different orders.<br><br>
There is a one-to-many relationship between UserProfile and Order as one user can have many orders associated with them. The UserProfile table also has a one-to-one link with the built-in Django User model (shown here for demonstration purposes) as each user can have only one profile linked to them. The BlogPost table has a one-to-many relationship with Reply, which allows for multiple replies to a particular blog post. There is also a one-to-many relationship between the User model and the Reply table as one user may have many replies.<br><br>

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created on Balsamiq (see links below)

* [Mobile](media/wireframes/mobile-wireframe.pdf)
* [Tablet](media/wireframes/tablet-wireframe.pdf)
* [Desktop](media/wireframes/desktop-wireframe.pdf)

Some final design choices aren't reflected in wireframes.
